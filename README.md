# Advantages over s_shake
1. Better perfomance (if still not enough, you can bake all expressions for even better perfomance)  
2. Frequency keyframe animation is smooth and correct, perfomance expensive tho (in s_shake it's twitchy and incorrect)
3. Works in one space, when applied to a single layer (if you move the layer out the comp and move it back with another shake, the edges of the layer won't be cut)  
4. Anchor point controls  
5. No plugins needed  
6. Free!
