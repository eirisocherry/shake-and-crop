# Advantages over s_shake
1. Better performance  
- If preset applying takes so long, clean your `Support Files\Presets` folder (the less presets you have in this folder, the faster applying is)  
- If you need even better performance, just bake the expressions (you can use my other script for this: https://github.com/eirisocherry/camera-time-remapping)  
2. Frequency keyframe animation is smooth and correct, performance expensive tho (in s_shake it's twitchy and incorrect)  
3. Works in one space, when applied to a single layer (if you move the layer out the comp and move it back with another shake/crop, the edges of the layer won't be cut)  
4. Anchor point controls  
5. No plugins needed  
6. Free!  

## Installation
